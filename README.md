# bubbleSort

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array.

Pseudocode:

#Compare first two index

#Swap position if value of index 2 is smaller than value of index 1

    #Insert first then Delete index 2 value if there is a swap

#Do for the remaining index

Note:
Max iteration = array.length-1
For huge array, if array is in correct order, raise a flag for sorted
Also, after first iteration, last element cna be ignored, so on
